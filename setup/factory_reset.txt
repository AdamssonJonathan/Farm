FACTORY RESET

If this is your first time running Farmbot (or you are resetting the bot to
default) you will need to run a "factory reset".

A factory reset will delete all scheduled operations and calibration settings.

It will *not* delete information stored outsdie of the bot (such as WebApp
settings).

Shall I perform a factory reset of all local settings (schedules, positions)? (y/n)
