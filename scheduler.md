# Problem
* we need a way to manage processes between the frontend and the bot
  * Obviously not EVERY process, but just a small subset of them
    * Farmware, Sequences, Regimens and FarmEvents
  * Preferable an interface that can be used to represent all of these things
    without being too specific to any, but not to generic to be useful.
